I liked the feature in the Cosmic desktop environment where i could use the up/down arrow keys, and a window or the focus would move up or down the workspaces associated with the monitor it was on  
i havent found a way to do this on hyprland yet, so im doing it in rust using the `hyprctl` command line tool to move windows or the focus
